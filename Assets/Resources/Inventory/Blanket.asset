  description: Woven from the softest threads of twilight, this Blanket holds the
    warmth of countless starlit nights. Its touch is said to banish loneliness, wrapping
    its wearer in a cocoon of comfort and quiet courage. Tales speak of it glowing
    faintly in times of need, as though it whispers lullabies from a realm of peace.
