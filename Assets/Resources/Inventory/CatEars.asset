  description: Fashioned by a whimsical artisan inspired by the mysterious grace
    of feline companions, these enchanted Cat Ears are said to amplify their wearer's
    curiosity and agility. Whispers tell of their soft glow under the moonlight,
    as if channeling the watchful gaze of a thousand nocturnal hunters. Those who
    wear them often feel an uncanny connection to the shadows, moving with quiet
    confidence and a playful spirit.
