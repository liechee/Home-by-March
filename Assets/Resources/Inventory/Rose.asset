  description: Plucked from a garden said to bloom in eternal twilight, this Rose
    carries the scent of fleeting memories and unspoken promises. Its petals glow
    softly, as if holding onto the light of a sunset. Tales speak of it inspiring
    courage in the face of loss, its thorns a reminder that even beauty has its defenses.
