  description: "Forged under a meteor shower, the Star Shield gleams with the brilliance
    of countless wishes made upon falling stars. It\u2019s said to protect not just
    the body, but also the dreams of its bearer, glowing brighter with each act of
    bravery. Legends claim it resonates with a celestial hum, as though calling upon
    the cosmos to guide its wielder."
