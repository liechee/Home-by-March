    - "\"Mmm\u2026 I remember a tale, old as the roots in this forest. They spoke
      of a treasure \u2014 a gift left behind by a traveler who walked where no light
      dared follow.\""
  - lines:
    - "\"Not gold, no\u2026 but something brighter. A rod of silver flame, they said,
      warm to the touch, as if it remembered the hands that held it. The more one
      held on to hope, the brighter it burned.\""

    - '"They say it pulsed like a heartbeat. Some claimed to hear music when they
      gripped it tight and stood tall. A melody only the brave could hear."'
